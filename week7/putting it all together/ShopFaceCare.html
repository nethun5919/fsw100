    <h1>Face Cleaning</h1>
<p>Cleansing is hardly the most glamorous step in a skin-care lineup, but in many ways, it's the most important. Whether your skin-care regimen consists of a basic wash-and-moisture duo or it qualifies as something of a ritual, starting with a fresh canvas is a necessary step to reap the benefits of all that skin-loving goodness you layer on afterward.</p>

<p>Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser</p>
   <p> Glossier's Milky Jelly Cleanser washes the day away as good as any all-star cleanser, but there’s something about the bouncy jelly consistency, just-sweet-enough rosewater scent, and clean — yet supremely hydrated — result that will make you actually look forward to washing your face.</p>
