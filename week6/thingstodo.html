    <h1>SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST FAVARITE PLACE TO VISIT.</h1> 

   <article>
       <h2>Amsterdam the capital of the Netherlands</h2>
             <span>April 9th, 2021</span>
             <p><img src="https://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/travel/destination-images/netherlands/amsterdam/1400-hero-amsterdam-netherlands-dusk.imgcache.rev1409080358231.web.jpg" aligin="top"height="150"/>
              Amsterdam was founded at the Amstel, that was dammed to control flooding, and the city's name derives from the Amstel dam.[12] Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, and became the leading centre for finance and trade.[13] In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded and many new neighbourhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century canals of Amsterdam and the 19–20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Sloten, annexed in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam, is the oldest part of the city, dating to the 9th century.</p>

<p>The number one country for culture, the Netherlands boasts a huge array of museums, galleries, and concert halls to visit, and has produced such talents as Rembrandt, van Gogh, and Vermeer. Its main cities are also an architecture haven. Here’s proof: Brief guide to Rotterdam’s architecture.</p>

    <h1>Africa.</h1>
    <h2>The second most largest continent</h2>

     <p>Africa’s total land area is approximately 112021,724,000 square miles (30,365,000 square km), and the continent measures about 5,000 miles (8,000 km) from north to south and about 4,600 miles (7,400 km) from east to west. Its northern extremity is Al-Ghīrān Point, near Al-Abyaḍ Point (Cape Blanc), Tunisia; its southern extremity is Cape Agulhas, South Africa; its farthest point east is Xaafuun (Hafun) Point, near Cape Gwardafuy (Guardafui), Somalia; and its western extremity is Almadi Point (Pointe des Almadies), on Cape Verde (Cap Vert), Senegal. In the northeast, Africa was joined to Asia by the Sinai Peninsula until the construction of the Suez Canal. Paradoxically, the coastline of Africa—18,950 miles (30,500 km) in length—is shorter than that of Europe, because there are few inlets and few large bays or gulfs.</p>
     <p> At Victoria Falls, you can bungee off a bridge, swim up to the edge of the world's largest waterfall, or white-water raft down some of the wildest rapids on Earth. Uganda and Ethiopia also offer first-class rafting.</p>

    <h1>United Kingdom</h1>
      <h2> United Kingdom of Great Britain </h2>
       <span>April 9th, 2021</span>
      <p><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/08/14/15/22/canal-5488271_1280.jpg"aligin ="top"height="150"/>
     <p> The United Kingdom comprises the whole of the island of Great Britain—which contains England, Wales, and Scotland—as well as the northern portion of the island of Ireland. The name Britain is sometimes used to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole. The capital is London, which is among the world’s leading commercial, financial, and cultural centres. Other major cities include Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester in England, Belfast and Londonderry in Northern Ireland, Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland, and Swansea and Cardiff in Wales.</p>
      <p>From concert halls and art galleries to Michelin Star restaurants and UNESCO World Heritage Sites, there’s a lot to explore across the United Kingdom.</p>
