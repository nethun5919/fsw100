<p>Is it time you brushed up on your makeup tools? They can make all the difference when you’re trying to create your look. With a brush for every makeup need, from a foundation brush, blusher brush or eyeshadow brush, ours are made from bamboo and aluminium. Their super soft, dense, nylon bristles are completely cruelty-free and ensure maximum performance. We also have a great range of makeup tools, like our Blending Sponge – never fear a foundation streak again, or our anti-fade and anti-smudge Setting Spray, and who doesn’t love an accessory? We’ve got sharpeners and curlers. Get the most out of your makeup with tools that really do their job.</p>
